Description: Building on top of the 'RcppArmadillo' linear
    algebra functionalities to do fast spatial interaction models in the
    context of urban analytics, geography, transport modelling. It uses
    the Newton root search algorithm to determine the optimal cost
    exponent and can run country level models with thousands of origins
    and destinations. It aims at implementing an easy approach based on
    matrices, that can originate from various routing and processing steps earlier in an workflow. 
    Currently, the simplest form of production, destination and
    doubly constrained models are implemented.
