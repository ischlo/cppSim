# cppSim 0.2

The main update of this version is the integration of the armadillo library to the package to facilitate dependencies on the user side. 

A vignette now introduces the minimal workflow using `cppSim`, another one goes through the basics of spatial interaction models with a simple R implementation. 
A soon to be published one will cover a case study with network and routing steps from scratch.
